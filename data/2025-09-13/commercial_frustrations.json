Persona insights:** AI-generated profiles of decision-makers, including communication tips.\n\n**Goal:** I\u2019m **not trying to sell it yet**. I just want feedback from early testers to see if this is worth pursuing or if I\u2019m barking up the wrong tree.\n\nIf you\u2019re in B2B sales (or have friends who are), would you find this useful?

Negotiate scope?\n\nAnd how do you manage that with the devs you\u2019re working with, without completely breaking their workflow or blowing up the scope?\n\nWould love to hear how you balance keeping momentum while still protecting the project from spiraling out of control:) Maybe it'll ",

At the same time, I changed how we handled procurement. By using Scanmarket from Unit4 I was able to centralize RFQs and documentation, without wasting time chasing scattered versions and endless emails.\n\nIt also made a big difference for management visibility. Instead of presenting fragments and partial tables, I could show a unified view of progress, which reduced a lot of contradictory discussions. The team understood the bottlenecks faster, and stakeholders saw that even if the project was more complex than it looked at first, there was a clear framework keeping everything under control.",

The problem is, they don\u2019t actually build defensive skills, since people stay passive instead of practicing what to do in real-life situations.\n\nWe\u2019re taking a different approach: an interactive 3D office environment where you face realistic incidents from a first-person perspective.\n\nYou\u2019ll get hands-on experience dealing with scenarios like:\n\n* Spotting phishing indicators in a suspicious email\n* Handling a scam phone call (vishing) under pressure\n* Downloading a malicious file and watching the consequences unfold\n\n**It\u2019s 100% free to use.** Right now, there are 9 sample exercises live on our site, with 14 more on the way. We\u2019re also building out quiz questions to reinforce the lessons.\n\nYou can use it to train employees, help friends or family, or even test yourse",

I\u2019m more of a builder than a marketer, so sharing this publicly is a little scary \n\nI\u2019ve been here for a while, seeing amazing projects, and wasn\u2019t sure if I should post mine.

You add a short Loom-style video  to any deck/proposal/contract, and the recipient sees the doc\u00a0*and*\u00a0hears your context. There\u2019s real-time tracking so you can tell who viewed, which pages they lingered on, and when to follow up.\n\nThink:\u00a0**DocSend with Loom inside**\u00a0\u2014 but lightweight and accessible.\n\n**Why I built it:**  \nI kept sending \u201csilent\u201d decks and getting vague replies (or none). I realized the missing piece was\u00a0**me**\u00a0\u2014 the explanation that turns a document into a conversation.\n\nWhat it does (right now):\n\n* Add a 3m video bubble to any PDF\n* real-time notifications + page-le",

    "text": "I\u2019m a single mom who\u2019s partner passed when my child was 9 months old. I managed to finish my bachelors degree, finish my additional college credits needed to sit for the CPA exam, and pass all 4 CPA exams, amidst coordinating  my child\u2019s autism journey(occupational, behavioral, and speech therapy) in the last 6 years since his death, so I am proud of all that. \n\nHowever, due to me raising a small child on the spectrum and balancing my academic pursuits at the same time, my lack of work experience is hindering me from landing an associate position. My last internship was beginning of 2022, so my resume isn\u2019t as intriguing in comparison to fresh young graduates. I know I\u2019m resilient and a hard worker, and am willing to take on any challenge, but I don\u2019t have connections to hiring recruiters or opportunities to attend Meet the Firms anymore. I guess the other rough part about my situation is that I\u2019m trying to maintain living in San Jose, CA so I can be near extended family for my child. ",

Since then, I have been taking tests by professionals to get a proper diagnosis, but it seems like I'm ADD at the very least.\n\nBut I'm preoccupied with labels. I'm overtly forgetful and tend to get distracted easily. I am an accounting student, and I often mix up numbers, which results in me failing tests (but recovering it thereafter). I often do as well as people without ADHD, yet it seems like this syndrome prevents me from reaching my ceiling.\n\nI was accepted in an internship (4 hours a day). Here, I am very insecure about forgetting or mixing up stuff.\n\nDo you have any tips for me not to mix up numbers? Like when I'm doing an assignment with too many of them and end up reading 7634,89 but writing 7634,86. This is fatal because I can get a whole test wrong for that. And now I can't confuse these numbers because it's my work, and it can get me fired at any instant.",
