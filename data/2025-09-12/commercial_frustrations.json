As far as I know, they haven\u2019t had an engineering or science intern before, mainly marketing and business interns. The firm has been primarily a more traditional real estate company for the last 150 years. Many tasks are done through SQL queries and Excel. Much of the product team at the company has been there for over 20 years and is resistant to change.\n\nThe ceo wants to make the company more efficient and modern, and implement some statistical and ML models and automated workflows with their large amounts of data. He has given me some of the ideas that he and others at the company have considered. I will list those at the end. But I am starting to feel that I\u2019m a bit in over my head here as he hinted towards using my work as a ",

To summarize, this tool specifically helps with,  \n  \n1. **Total Addressable Market (TAM) discovery:** quickly size and identify the right markets.\n\n2. **Company intelligence**: insights on revenue, industry, pain points, and competitor comparisons.\n\n**3. Persona insights:** AI-generated profiles of decision-makers, including communication tips.\n\n**Goal:** I\u2019m **not trying to sell it yet**. I just want feedback from early testers to see if this is worth pursuing or if I\u2019m barking up the wrong tree.\n\nIf you\u2019re in B2B sales (or have friends who are), would you find this useful?

Hoping that someone might be able to guide me to a more elegant sorting solution for my 3d printing orders.\nI'm working on a 755 piece custom 3d print run with 2- 3d printers. Each piece has a base color and text color dropdown column with about 30 color options listed. (Soooo maaaany color combos) \nMy rows are currently sorted by the Base Color column (A-Z) first, and then the Text Color  column (A-Z). I've exasperated myself trying to figure out how to sort things further so that I can batch print more efficiently. \n\nEx. I'd like to be able to view and batch print all items with \nBase Color- Royal Blue + Text Color- Red \nat the same time with all \nBase Color- Red + Text Color- Royal Blue \n\nWhile not specifically sheets related, if there are other ways to sort/prioritize/automate things using 2 Printers that can print up to 4 colors at once, I'm all ears for that as well.\n\nThis is my first run, so I'm trying to streamline the workflow as much as possible for future and like",

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have a project where it's **extra critical that the RLS works as intended**.\n\nThe RLS itself is simple: **static RLS roles** (security groups). A few dim_tables filter all fact tables in the semantic model.\n\nHowever, it's crucial that the RLS doesn't get **unintentionally removed or broken** during the lifetime of the report and semantic model. Things that might happen:\n\n- The **RLS definition** gets dropped from a dimension table during alterations.\n- A **table relationship** gets dropped, causing the dimension table to no longer filter the fact table.\n\nHow can I minimize the risk of such errors occurring, or at least prevent them from being deployed to prod?\n\nWe're primarily using **Power BI Desktop** for semantic model and report development and **Fabric** with premium features.\n\n#RLS or separate semantic models?\nWould you recommend creating **separate semantic models** instead? We only have 5 static roles, so we could create separate semantic models (**filtered clones**)",

Things like rotating proxies, handling CAPTCHAs, and managing schema changes become painful really quickly.\n\nI came across hyperbrowser while looking into different approaches, and it made me wonder if there\u2019s actually a \u201cclean\u201d way to treat scraping like a proper data pipeline, similar to how we handle ETL in more traditional contexts.\n\nDo you usually integrate scraped data directly into your data warehouse or lake, or do you keep it separate first? How do you personally deal with sites that keep changing layouts so you don\u2019t end up rewriting extractors every other week? And at what point do you just say it\u2019s easier to buy the data instead of maintaining the scrapers?\n",
