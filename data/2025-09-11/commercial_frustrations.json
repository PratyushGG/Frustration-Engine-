As far as I know, they haven\u2019t had an engineering or science intern before, mainly marketing and business interns. The firm has been primarily a more traditional real estate company for the last 150 years. Many tasks are done through SQL queries and Excel. Much of the product team at the company has been there for over 20 years and is resistant to change.\n\nThe ceo wants to make the company more efficient and modern, and implement some statistical and ML models and automated workflows with their large amounts of data. He has given me some of the ideas that he and others at the company have considered. I will list those at the end. But I am starting to feel that I\u2019m a bit in over my head here as he hinted towards using my work as a ",

For most of my career I have been the person shoveling data, cleaning up processes, and building the glue that keeps businesses running. It is not flashy work, but I enjoy it, especially when it removes bottlenecks for small companies that do not have big IT budgets.\n\nNow I am exploring the idea of turning that into a business. The model would be consulting-driven: Sit down with small businesses, map out how they really operate, help them spot inefficiencies, and then create lightweight solutions (automations, tailored CRMs, or other tools) that fit their processes instead of overwhelming them. My ideal customer knows he has to do something to be more effective and knows his business better than anybody else.\n\nWhere I am weaker is sales and outreach. I can deliver value once I am in the room, but I have never been the person who gets into the room. I am a bit of an introvert. I am very good at talking abo",

It stopped feeling like conversations and more like forms being filled out, and people just stopped answering.\n\nI've tried a bunch of ways to fix that. Narrowing down segments has helped a little since it keeps the tone closer to what matters for each group. I also tested out a few tools to take some of the busywork off my plate. One of them was Sendr, which I found through AppSumo, and I'll admit I wasn't sure it would work.

Break down product requirements as granularly as possible so any developer on your team can understand and estimate them easily. How do you know it's small enough? For me, I know it's the right size when my developers estimate a task at one day or less.\n2. Ask your development team to reinterpret or explain the product requirements to ensure they're aligned with your vision.

I\u2019m more of a builder than a marketer, so sharing this publicly is a little scary \n\nI\u2019ve been here for a while, seeing amazing projects, and wasn\u2019t sure if I should post mine. I\u2019m worried about feeling judged\u2026 but I could really use honest feedback and a few testers.\n\n**What I built:**  \nSend (A Docsend Alternative)\u2014 a simple way to share a document\u00a0*with you in it*. You add a short Loom-style video  to any deck/proposal/contract, and the recipient sees the doc\u00a0*and*\u00a0hears your context. There\u2019s real-time tracking so you can tell who viewed, which pages they lingered on, and when to follow up.\n\nThink:\u00a0**DocSend with Loom inside**\u00a0\u2014 but lightweight and accessible.\n\n**Why I built it:**  \nI kept sending \u201csilent\u201d decks and getting vague replies (or none). I realized the missing piece was\u00a0**me**\u00a0\u2014 the explanation that turns a document into a conversation.\n\nWhat it does (right now):\n\n* Add a 3m video bubble to any PDF\n* real-time notifications + page-le",
