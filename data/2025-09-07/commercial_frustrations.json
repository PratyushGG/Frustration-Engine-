As far as I know, they haven\u2019t had an engineering or science intern before, mainly marketing and business interns. The firm has been primarily a more traditional real estate company for the last 150 years. Many tasks are done through SQL queries and Excel. Much of the product team at the company has been there for over 20 years and is resistant to change.\n\nThe ceo wants to make the company more efficient and modern, and implement some statistical and ML models and automated workflows with their large amounts of data. He has given me some of the ideas that he and others at the company have considered. I will list those at the end. But I am starting to feel that I\u2019m a bit in over my head here as he hinted towards using my work as a ",

A while back, there were two main players: Meituan, which was leading, and Eleme, which was struggling a bit. Then, around April, Meituan introduced a new feature called \u201cFlash Purchase\u201d to challenge Jingdong. Jingdong responded by saying, \u201cFood delivery looks appealing, and Meituan has it all. Let\u2019s get involved!\u201d\nJingdong, mainly an e-commerce platform, launched its own food delivery feature called \u201cInstant Delivery\u201d and included a lot of discount vouchers. I remember getting milk teas for just 1 yuan- crazy, right? Meituan was relaxed, thinking, \u201cOur customers are loyal.

It stopped feeling like conversations and more like forms being filled out, and people just stopped answering.\n\nI've tried a bunch of ways to fix that. Narrowing down segments has helped a little since it keeps the tone closer to what matters for each group. I also tested out a few tools to take some of the busywork off my plate. One of them was Sendr, which I found through AppSumo, and I'll admit I wasn't sure it would work.

I was up at 2am hoping vlookup wouldnt break. scared someone would ask me what a pipeline even was. most meetings I was secretly googling acronyms so I didnt look like a fraud.\n\nNow a couple years later I am the one building dashboards leadership relies on. this week I demoed a project that pulled data from messy sources and automated a report that used to take weeks. people clapped at the end. my manager said I saved the company hundreds of thousands. But I still feel like the same person duct taping spreadsheets together in the dark.\n\nIs this just imposter syndrome or does everyone in data feel like the ground is always shifting? how do you convince yourself you belong when your head says you dont?",
